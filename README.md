# Bablok

A classic block matching (and apparently heavily litigious) game implementation in pygame.

## Status

Completely playable.  I had to run through a few rounds at low level to make sure level up was working and was fun.

Debating where levels eight and nine should be.  They seem about right.
Seven seems reasonable, eight seems rough, but doable, nine will kill you off on first miss step.
